In the AI deployment strategy, an important decision is to be made. Should we use private LLM or RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) approach?

## Private LLM
A private LLM is a large language model that is hosted and operated within an organization's own infrastructure or a secure cloud environment, rather than being accessed through a public API provided by third-party vendors. This approach allows organizations to maintain greater control over their data, ensure compliance with privacy regulations, and customize the model to better suit their specific needs.

Unlike ChatGPT, Google Gemini, this model only runs for your business and does not share any data with external parties. This is particularly important for industries that handle sensitive information, such as finance, healthcare or legal sectors.

In financial industry, a private LLM could be used to process applications, analyze transactions, generate financial reports and analytics. It allows greater control to comply with regulatory requirements such as GDPR, PCI DSS etc.

Key aspects of private LLMs include:
- Control over the training data.
- Ability to embed proprietary knowledge and niche or domain-specific information.
- Ability to maintain complete control over sensitive client or proprietary data.

Challenges with private LLMs:
- High initial costs for computing infrastructure and model training.
- Operational cost associated with maintaining and updating the model.
- Performance gap compared to state-of-the-art public models.


## The RAG Approach
A practical, yet sophisticated alternative that addresses an organization's core knowledge management needs without the overhead of maintaining a private LLM. It combines the powerful commercial LLMs with intelligent document retrieval system, delivers value much faster, yet maintains the future extensibility.

When a user asks a question, the RAG system first retrieves relevant company document, knowledge base, or other data sources. Then it feeds this context along with the user query to an LLM (e.g. ChatGPT, Gemini) to generate a response. This way, the model can provide accurate and contextually relevant answers without needing to be trained on all the specific details of the organization's data.

The advantages of RAG over private LLM include:
First, the latest company document and knowledge are maintained relevant and up-to-date through routine indexing rather than expensive model training. New knowledge becomes available immediately, usually through automated pipelines. This ensures the responses are based on the latest information.

Second, it leverages the most advanced LLMs available, provides superior analytical capabilities compared to the private LLMs. As the commercial LLMs improve, RAG systems can benefit from these advancements without additional investment or technical overhead.

Third, the implementation timeline and resource requirement for RAG systems are dramatically shorter.

But how about the security concerns with the commercial LLMs? Security concerns drive teams to consider private LLMs. However, with RAG approach, sensitive data is never sent to the LLM. Only the relevant context extracted from the organization's own data is shared with the LLM, ensuring that proprietary or confidential information remains secure. Additionally, modern RAG systems can be designed with access control, controlled encryption, and audit logging to further enhance data security. Geographic deployment enable compliance with data sovereignty requirements.

On top of that, major providers like Microsoft, OpenAI offer enterprise agreement with specific legal data protections:
- All communications remain private and temporary
- No data retention or model train use
- Information exists only in the momentary context window
- Complete isolation from other users' data

LLMs can't remember or share the data user send to them, regardless private or public. To the contrary, the data sent for analysis typically stays with the LLM for about the time it takes to respond. Further requests to the LLM must include the previous information (in the context window) in your conversation.

## RAG systems are inevitable?!
Once trained, the LLMs exist in a static state and cannot incorporate new information without complete retraining. Given the substantial costs and technical complexity of retraining, most organizations find monthly or quarterly update of the private LLM impractical. A RAG system, in contrast, can continuously integrate new information as it becomes available, ensuring that the responses remain accurate and relevant over time.
