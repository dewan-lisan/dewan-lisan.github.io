## RAG Application
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application combines the capabilities of a language model with a retrieval system to provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses. This approach is particularly useful for applications that require up-to-date information or specific domain knowledge.

## AI Agent
AI agents are intelligent applications designed to automate tasks and enhance human productivity. They can analyze information, make decisions and take actions to achieve specific goals, freeing up time and resources for more strategic work.
For example:
- **Customer service agent:** These agents interact with customers, understand their queries and provide timely and relevant responses, aiming to improve customer satisfaction and resolve issues efficiently
- **Code generation agent:** These agents assist developers by writing, debugging and optimizing code based on given requirements, streamlining the software development process and improving productivity
- **Data analysis and reporting:** These agents are particularly useful for financial industry that need to process large volumes of data quickly and accurately to meet regulatory and compliance requirements.

### Financial Service Industry Use Cases
Regulatory compliance data analysis and automating reporting processes

## Key Difference Between GenAI, RAG and AI Agent
| Feature            | Generative AI                                 | RAG Application                                                 | AI Agent                                                             |

| Core Functionality | Generates new content (text, images, etc.)    | Retrieval and generation of relevant content                    | Autonomous decision making and action execution                      |  
| Architecture       | Prompt -> LLM -> Output                       | Prompt -> Retriever -> Context -> LLM -> Output                 | ???                                                                  |  
| Decision-Making    | Requires specific prompts to generate content | Relies on retrieved data to generate responses                  | Makes independent decisions and takes actions once goals are defined |
| Risk Factors       | May produce biased or incorrect content       | May retrieve irrelevant or outdated content                     | Can make decisions that may lead to unintended consequences          |

| Adaptability       | ???                                           | Adaptable based on available external data                      | Continuously learns and refines strategies over time                 |
| Use Cases          | Content creation, summarization, translation  | Answer questions based on company docs (e.g., customer support) | Book travel, automate data pipelines, research assistant             |
